🔹 Core Principle

> *“Information must serve humanity, not rule it.”* — U Ingar Soe, 2025  

Our guiding formula for **Moral AI** is:
\[
Moral_{AI} = (Humanity + Context) \times Transparency^{2}
\]

This ensures AI systems become not weapons of manipulation, but guardians of fairness, transparency, and accountability.
